# ðŸš€ SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

This project tackles a real-world challenge faced by SpaceX: Can we predict whether a Falcon 9 first-stage booster will land successfully, before launch, using historical mission data?

Leveraging data from the SpaceX API and public sources, I built an end-to-end data science pipelineâ€”from automated data collection and rigorous cleaning, to in-depth exploratory analysis, interactive mapping, dashboard creation, and machine learning modeling.

- Unified, analysis-ready dataset combining API and web data on launches, sites, orbits, payloads, and recovery outcomes.  
- Interactive dashboards and geospatial maps enable rapid exploration of launch patterns and success rates by site, orbit, and payload.  
- ML-powered predictions: Trained, tuned, and compared several classifiersâ€”including Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Treeâ€”to predict landing success with high accuracy.  
- Actionable insights: Identified which launch sites and mission profiles drive the highest landing success, and discovered how payload mass and orbit impact outcomes.

This capstone demonstrates my ability to solve end-to-end business problems with data engineering, analytics, visualization, and predictive modelingâ€”all skills directly transferable to industry roles in data science and analytics.

## Project Highlights

- **Endâ€‘toâ€‘end pipeline:** Data collection (SpaceX API + Wikipedia scraping) â†’ data wrangling â†’ EDA (plots & SQL) â†’ interactive Folium maps â†’ Plotly Dash dashboard â†’ ML model training & evaluation.
- Created a unified, clean dataset of Falcon 9 launches, outcomes, and site/orbit/payload details.
- Built dashboards and maps to enable rapid exploration and visualization of launch trends.
- Trained and compared multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN) to predict firstâ€‘stage landing outcomes.

## Key Findings

- **Topâ€‘performing launch sites:** In this dataset, **CCAFS SLCâ€‘40** and **KSC LCâ€‘39A** consistently achieved the highest firstâ€‘stage landing success rates.
- **Payload mass effect:** Most landing successes cluster below **~6,000â€¯kg**; heavier payloads show more variable outcomes.
- **Orbit impact:** **SSO (polar), GEO, and HEO** orbits show nearâ€‘perfect recovery rates in this sample, while **GTO** lags at ~50%.
- **Best model:** The **Decision Tree** classifier achieved the highest **crossâ€‘validated** accuracy (â‰ˆ **0.89**). On the **holdâ€‘out test** set, all models achieved **~0.83** accuracy.
